# Samizdat: a web of content

## Introduction

In these troubling times, some people might find it hard to publish content to the web. Samizdat is a P2P network for sharing and publishing content without the need of a server, most of which are run by _them_. Self-publish your content today with Samizdat!

### Warning

This is only a proof of concept implementation. It might work in a small scenario, but breaking changes will be needed to be made for it to scale for the whole Web.

And, as always, be aware that, since this is a nascent project, vulnerabilities might exist that nobody has any idea of yet. By now, tread carefully.
